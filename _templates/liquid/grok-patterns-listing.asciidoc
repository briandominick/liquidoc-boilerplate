= Weird Regex Pattern Handling

This page performs layout against fairly arbitrary source data in the form of regular expressions.
The source file is a text file with one record per line. Each record is a solid string (alphanumeric with underscores) followed by a single space and then a Grok pattern.
We will use two different templates to output the same source in two different formats.
This AsciiDoc file is the result of one of those templates (`_templates/grok-patterns-listing.adoc`).

{% for r in data %}
