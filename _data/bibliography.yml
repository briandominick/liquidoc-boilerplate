# FORMAT
# This format is based on CSL standard
# http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/index.html
#
# I've only spent about 6 hours researching bibliography/citation styles/structures/standards,
# so this implementation is pretty limited. Must do more research and explore some of the
# tools like https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby.
